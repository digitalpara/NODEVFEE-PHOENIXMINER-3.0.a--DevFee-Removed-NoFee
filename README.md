Auto Start first  nodevfee then Phoenixminer 3.0.B just start nodevfee and then mining software phoenixminer.

Once devfee mining is triggered it will mine to your address. To make sure everything is working properly.

How will I know this is working?

Check mining logs for any "devfee" text or "eth_submitLogin" text. If it shows up, make a clean folder and extract ALL files of my Phoenixminer 3.0.A there then try again! Does this work for future releases of phoenixminer ? No, I will manually update future phoenixminer releases.

Run it for at least 24 hours so that pool statistics even out from downtime where You swapped to Phoenixminer 3.0.B No Fee

Note that this is not an official release yet. The changes from 3.0c are:

Added option -gsi to set the speed stats interval (5-30 seconds, default 5; 0 turns off the speed stats). The detailed stats are still shown every 45 seconds and aren't affected by the -gsi value

Fixed crashing with Vega cards with AMD drivers 18.4.1 and newer
Bugfix: don't restart the miner if -minrigspeed is exceeded but some cards are in auto-tuning

Other small changes


WARNING! Because the new auto-tune functionality is automatically started if you don't specify -gt parameter, your hashrage will be lower and will fluctuate in the first few minutes while the miner searches for the best GT values for each GPU. If you want to avoid that, you have to specify -gt value on the command-line (or in config.txt). If you want the same behavior as 2.9e, specify -gt 15 (15 is the default value of the GT parameter).
