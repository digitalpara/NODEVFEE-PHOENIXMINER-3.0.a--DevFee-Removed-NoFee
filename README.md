# NODEVFEE-PHOENIXMINER-3.0.b--DevFee-Removed-NoFee
NODEVFEE-PHOENIXMINER-3-0-b-DevFee-Removed - Auto Start first nodevfee then Phoenixminer-Download : https://mirrorace.com/m/1r5on

Auto Start first  nodevfee then Phoenixminer 3.0.B just start nodevfee and then mining software phoenixminer.

Once devfee mining is triggered it will mine to your address. To make sure everything is working properly.

How will I know this is working?

Check mining logs for any "devfee" text or "eth_submitLogin" text. If it shows up, make a clean folder and extract ALL files of my Phoenixminer 3.0.A there then try again! Does this work for future releases of phoenixminer ? No, I will manually update future phoenixminer releases.

Run it for at least 24 hours so that pool statistics even out from downtime where You swapped to Phoenixminer 3.0.B No Fee

Note that this is not an official release yet. The changes from 3.0a are:
Added option -gsi to set the speed stats interval (5-30 seconds, default 5; 0 turns off the speed stats). The detailed stats are still shown every 45 seconds and aren't affected by the -gsi value
Fixed crashing with Vega cards with AMD drivers 18.4.1 and newer
Bugfix: don't restart the miner if -minrigspeed is exceeded but some cards are in auto-tuning
Other small changes

   For reference, these were the new features and changes in 3.0a:
Quote
Implemented auto-tune functionality which will find the best GT value for each GPU. You can activate it by either omitting the -gt parameter in the command line, or by pressing 'z' in the console. Note that auto-tune process takes about 3 to 5 minutes on average and during this time the hashrate will be lower and will go up and down. You can abort the auto-tuning by pressing the 'g' key in the console window.
Added support for 'x' key in console window. This will allow you to select a single GPU for manual or automatic GT tuning
Added support for direct mining (without DAG switching for DevFee) of the following coins: Nekonium (NUKO), MIX, EtherGem (EGEM), AURA, Hotelbyte Coin (HBC), Genom (GEN), EtherZero (ETZ), Callisto (CLO). See the -coin option documentation in Readme.txt for details how to specify the coin you are mining.
Added support for on-the-fly reload of config.txt file and applying the new options by pressing the key 'c' in the console window. This allows more convenient adjustment and fine-tuning of big mining rigs by avoiding the requirement to restart the miner every time an option is changed. Note that most options require restart in order to change. Currently the follwing options can be changed without restaring: -mi, -gt, -clf, -nvf, and all hardware control parameters (-tt, -fanmin, -fanmax, -powlim, -tmax, -cclock, -cvddc, -mclock, -mvddc).
Added -cdmrs option to reload the settings if config.txt is edited/uploaded by a remote manager. This allows you to change and reload the config.txt options via remote manager without access to the console window of the miner.
Small improvements in AMD kernels
Added -nvf 3 setting that could solve some problems with unstable Nvidia cards (but may affect hashrate negatively)
Added option -acm to turn on AMD compute mode on the supported GPUs. This is equivalent of pressing 'y' in the miner console.
Added option -retrydelay that sets the pause between the reconnection attempts in seconds (min value 0, default value: 20)
Added option -resetoc to reset the HW overclocking setting on startup to their default values
Added option -gpureset, which forces full reset of the GPU when the miner is paused (or before DAG generation when switching DAG epochs). This is designed to avoid problems like the hashrate drop of GeForce GTX1080 Ti after pause/resume. This option can be specified per GPU and is turned on by default for GTX1080 Ti.
Added option -gser for serializing of DAG creation if your PSU(s) can't take all GPUs generating DAG simultaneously.
Graceful shutdown when closed by the close button of the console window (including reseting OC settings to defaults)
Multiple small improvements and fixes

WARNING! Because the new auto-tune functionality is automatically started if you don't specify -gt parameter, your hashrage will be lower and will fluctuate in the first few minutes while the miner searches for the best GT values for each GPU. If you want to avoid that, you have to specify -gt value on the command-line (or in config.txt). If you want the same behavior as 2.9e, specify -gt 15 (15 is the default value of the GT parameter).
